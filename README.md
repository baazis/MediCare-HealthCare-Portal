  <b><large> MediCare- Health Portal</b></large>
</h1>

## Description

<ul>
  <li>Our idea is to provide a platform for multiple
stakeholders like patients, doctors and healthcare
services and Ambulance providers to connect with
the help of a single application.</li>
  <li>With our website anyone can access features like seeing nearby
hospitals, getting live news related to HealthCare,
Covid19, Vaccination etc. 
</li>
  <li>Being a part of a community made easier than ever, users can interact
and discuss among themselves which would help
improve people perspectives about medical
conditions and a quick fitness test provides a handy
tool to test a person’s fitness spontaneously.</li>
</ul> 

## Idea Behind It

<ul>
  <li>A plethora of people are unaware of the easily accessible
healthcare services near them, the importance of which
has increased in these pandemic times.
</li>
  <li>According to a study, a large number of deaths are due to
people not being able to reach hospitals at correct time.</li>
  <li>During Covid-19 times, a large number of people are
unaware of the precautions and the nearby hospitals to
rush to in case of emergencies</li>
</ul> 

## Target Audience

<ul>
  
  ### Patient 
  <li>Patients can book Virtual Appointments
with Doctors and can connect to the
Doctor and Ambulance Services via a
real-time Video/Voice calling and
chatting feature for consultation. They
can book an ambulance in emergency
situations, and will get real time update
about the ambulance’s arrival</li>
  
  ### Doctor 
  <li>Doctors can confirm the
appointment and connect
with the patients for
Consultation via real time
and later generate and
upload detailed prescriptions
for the patient</li>
  
  ### Ambulance
  <li>Authorized Ambulance
Providers can register with our
website for paid/free services
to help people get easy access
to ambulance services in case
of emergency and being able
to live update the status of
their location.</li>
</ul>
