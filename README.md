  <b><large> MediCare- Health Portal</b></large>
</h1>

## Description

<ul>
  <li>Our idea is to provide a platform for multiple
stakeholders like patients, doctors and healthcare
services and Ambulance providers to connect with
the help of a single application.</li>
  <li>With our website anyone can access features like seeing nearby
hospitals, getting live news related to HealthCare,
Covid19, Vaccination etc. 
</li>
  <li>Being a part of a community made easier than ever, users can interact
and discuss among themselves which would help
improve people perspectives about medical
conditions and a quick fitness test provides a handy
tool to test a person’s fitness spontaneously.</li>
</ul> 

## Idea Behind It

<ul>
  
  <li>A plethora of people are unaware of the easily accessible
healthcare services near them, the importance of which
has increased in these pandemic times.
</li>
  
  <li>According to a study, a large number of deaths are due to
people not being able to reach hospitals at correct time.</li>
  
  <li>During Covid-19 times, a large number of people are
unaware of the precautions and the nearby hospitals to
rush to in case of emergencies</li>
  
</ul> 

## Target Audience

<ul>
  
  ### Patient 
  <li>Patients can book Virtual Appointments
with Doctors and can connect to the
Doctor and Ambulance Services via a
real-time Video/Voice calling and
chatting feature for consultation. They
can book an ambulance in emergency
situations, and will get real time update
about the ambulance’s arrival</li>
  
  ### Doctor 
  <li>Doctors can confirm the
appointment and connect
with the patients for
Consultation via real time
and later generate and
upload detailed prescriptions
for the patient</li>
  
  ### Ambulance
  <li>Authorized Ambulance
Providers can register with our
website for paid/free services
to help people get easy access
to ambulance services in case
of emergency and being able
to live update the status of
their location.</li>
</ul> 

## MODULES-

Our website has 3 main Stakeholders namely-
•	Patients
•	Doctors
•	Ambulances

So, MediCare is divided into 3 main Modules which are-

### PATIENT-
Patients have an option to book appointment with the doctor of their choice . They can check the status of the appointment and also the previous appointment details, where they can see the prescription uploaded by the doctor. 
Similarly, they can book Ambulances and check the status of the arrival of the ambulance.


### DOCTORS-
They can see the appointment requests by the patients, and can confirm the appointment according to their time.
They can upload the prescriptions for the previous completed appointments.


### AMBULANCE PROVIDERS-
They can provide free/paid services to the patients and update the status of their journey which will be shared with the patient.


Now the, HOME MODULE which contains features which doesn’t need for the user to be registered to the website.
=>GOOGLE MAPS API to fetch the nearby hospitals and police stations
=>News API to fetch the latest health news.
=>Community Benefit Insight API to fetch the nearby hospitals,and ambulance providers with their live bed count availability, and  an option to call them directly.
=>Community Space to ask questions, help other members, and even post articles/ blogs.
